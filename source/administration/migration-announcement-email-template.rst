Subject: New Communication Platform - Mattermost


Hi all,

As some of you already know, we are moving from **[System]** to Mattermost as our communication platform. We have imported our existing message data into Mattermost so we can continue to communicate, share files, and collaborate with the least disruption to our business. Mattermost has an easy to use interface and also integrates with many of the apps that you use every day, like **[add apps]**.

To get started:

1. Open a browser on your computer, go to **[Mattermost URL]** and select “Reset Password” to set your new password for Mattermost.  Enter in the email you used for **[System]**.  

2. Once you receive the email for resetting your password, go through the instructions to set your new password. Use your email and new password to log in. 

3. `Download <https://about.mattermost.com/download/#mattermostApps>`_ the Mattermost apps for desktop and mobile. Refer to the `Mattermost Welcome Guide <https://docs.mattermost.com/help/getting-started/welcome-to-mattermost.html>`_ on how to get up and running quickly.

4. Remember to bookmark the URL so you can use it to log in next time and start messaging!

If you have any questions, feel free to post in the **[~Mattermost channel]** or email us at **[IT email]**.
