Announcement Banner
===================

In Mattermost Enterprise Edition, an announcement banner is available that allows system administrators to display a notice that's visible to all users on the system.

By default, users can dismiss the banner until you either change the text of the banner or until you re-activate the banner. A setting in the System Console allows you to prevent users from dismissing the banner. You can also control the text color and the background color.

**To activate the banner**:

1. In the GENERAL section of the System Console, click **Policy**.
2. In the *Enable Announcement Banner* section, click **true**.
3. In the *Banner Text* field, enter the text of the announcement that you want to make.
4. Set the background and text colors.
5. Optional. To prevent users from dismissing the banner, in the *Allow Banner Dismissal* section, click **false**.
6. Click **Save**.
