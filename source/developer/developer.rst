WIP: Developers
====================================

At Mattermost, developers are thoughtful, highly independent engineers who work with both our open source contributor community and paid Mattermost staff to improve Mattermost software on a regular basis.

All Mattermost staff developers are also `core committers <https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/contribution-guide.html#core-committers>`_ on one or more official Mattermost repositories. They work closely with product management to envision, design, plan, develop, coordinate, review and merge improvements per our `contribution guidelines <https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/contribution-guide.html>`_ on a regular basis. 

Responsibilities

- Engage with the core team and the open source community to collaborate on improving Mattermost.
- Propose, coordinate, manage, review and merge code contributed by the rest of the community and work with them to get it ready for production.
- Work with our `documentation team <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/documentation-guidelines.html?>`_ to create and maintain technical information around features, configuration and troubleshooting. 
- Take initiative in improving the software in small or large ways to address pain points in your own experience as a developer.
