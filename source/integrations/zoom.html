Zoom Plugin
================================

1. The System Console settings live in System Console > Plugins > Zoom. This is where the admin needs to go 
configure Zoom for Mattermost. 
2. There are steps where you need to change a few settings in Zoom.
3. Once these steps are done, activate the plugin at System Console > Plugins > Management. 
4. Once activated, you will see a video icon in the channel header. There are three different actions you can take (start meeting now/start
meeting with topic/share meeting).

Setting for overriding usernames and icon URLs need to be set to true.
