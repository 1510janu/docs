Zoom Plugin
================================

With Zoom integration, Mattermost users can launch and join voice and video meetings without leaving 
the Mattermost interface. In addition to being able to customize Zoom, users can also extend the plugin 
to other video conferencing systems such as Skype and Google Hangouts.

_`Zoom <https://zoom.us/>`_ is one of the worldâ€™s leading video and web conferencing services. This 
documentation includes instructions on how you can set up Zoom in Mattermost.

Zoom Setup Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The System Console settings live in System Console > Plugins > Zoom. This is where the admin can
configure Zoom for Mattermost.

API Secret, and Webhook Secret.
