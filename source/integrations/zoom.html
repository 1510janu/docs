Zoom Plugin
================================

With Zoom integration, Mattermost users can launch and join voice and video meetings without leaving 
the Mattermost interface. In addition to being able to customize Zoom, users can also extend the plugin 
to other video conferencing systems such as Skype and Google Hangouts.

documentation includes instructions on how you can set up Zoom in Mattermost.
