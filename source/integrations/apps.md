# Community Applications

A listing of community applications can be found at http://www.mattermost.org/community-applications/

Work is in progress to have the growing list more effciently organized. The following categorization is under consideration to be applied to the applications: 

- Release: 
   -  Internal: Used for specific internal use cases for a single organization 
   -  Beta: Used by two or more organizations
   -  Released: Used by the Mattermost community with improvements made based on feedback. All key issues complete.
