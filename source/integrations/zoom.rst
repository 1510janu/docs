Zoom Plugin
================================

With `Zoom integration <https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-zoom>`_, Mattermost users can launch and join voice and video meetings without leaving 
the Mattermost interface. In addition to being able to customize Zoom, users can also extend the plugin 
to other video conferencing systems such as Skype and Google Hangouts.

`Zoom <https://zoom.us/>`_ is one of the worldâ€™s leading video and web conferencing services. This 
documentation includes instructions on how you can set up Zoom in Mattermost.

Zoom Setup Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The System Console settings live in **System Console > Plugins > Zoom**. This is where the admin can
configure Zoom for Mattermost.

2. Enable API Key, API Secret, and Webhook Secret in Zoom.

API Key and API Secret
.........................................

The API Key and API Secret are generated by Zoom. The API Key is used to create meetings and pull user data and the API Secret is used to create meetings and pull used data. To generate an API Key and API Secret:

1. Go to https://developer.zoom.us/me/ and login.
2. Switch to the API tab and click **Enable**, if not already enabled.
3. Switch back to the API tab and copy the API Key.
4. Paste the API Key into the field in the system console.

Webhook Secret
.........................................

This is the Secret used to authenticate the webhook to Mattermost. Use the webhook URL to set up the 
Zoom webhook. Then hit **Save**.

3. The setting for `overriding usernames <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#enable-integrations-to-override-usernames>`_ and `icon URLs <https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#enable-integrations-to-override-profile-picture-icons>`_ need to be set to true.

4. Once these steps are done, activate the plugin at **System Console > Plugins > Management** by clicking **Activate**.

5. Once activated, you will see a video icon in the channel header. Pressing the icon will open a drop-down menu with three different actions you can take (start meeting now/start meeting with topic/share meeting).
