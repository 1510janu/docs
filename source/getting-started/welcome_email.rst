Subject: New Communication Platform - Mattermost


Hi all,
 
As some of you already know, we are moving to Mattermost as our communication platform. Mattermost is a messaging app where you can talk, share files, and collaborate on projects or initiatives. Mattermost also integrate with many of the apps that you use everyday, like **[add apps]**.  

We are moving to Mattermost because it will allow us to become more productive by being able communicate in one place instead of using email, instant chat, and a multitude of other programs.

Some of the major benefits of using Mattermost are:

- Direct 1:1 and group messaging

- Channels for topic-based, group-based, or meeting-based chat

- Streamlined collaboration on projects

- Reduced email clutter

- Searching across messages and channels

- Sharing files

To get started:

1. Open a browser on your computer, go to **[Mattermost URL]** and log in with your **[LDAP/AD, SAML, Google, etc]** credentials. 

2. `Download <https://about.mattermost.com/download/#mattermostApps>`_ the Mattermost apps for desktop and mobile. Refer to the `Mattermost Welcome Guide <https://docs.mattermost.com/help/getting-started/welcome-to-mattermost.html>`_ on how to get up and running quickly.


3. Start messaging!
