**Mattermost** empowers organizations to achieve their highest priorities through secure, modern communication: an open source, workplace messaging solution for teams across web, mobile and PC with continuous archiving, instant search and integration with hundreds of third party applications. Thousands of organizations use Mattermost around the world in 11 languages: Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Dutch, English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, and Spanish.

Mattermost is highly extensible, connecting to more than 700 public cloud services via Zapier, and integrates with any system using webhooks, RESTful APIs and language-specific drivers. 

Mattermost is available in **Team Edition** and two **Enterprise Editions**, E10 and E20. Think of the Team Edition as a free, high quality and secure “virtual office” enabling all the members of a single team to work together anywhere in the world. Enterprise Editions provide additional security, configurability and scalability. Think of Enterprise Edition E10 as a “virtual campus” where you have a variety of teams and departments working in different offices or buildings and you therefore need advanced access controls. Enterprise Edition E20 provides the additional horizontal scalability and redundancy required to run a “virtual city”. 

**Mattermost Team Edition** is a free-to-use open source, self-hosted alternative to proprietary SaaS messaging. It deploys as single Linux binary on MySQL or PostgreSQL under an MIT license from https://about.mattermost.com/download. Features include:
