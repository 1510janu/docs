# Configuring Notifications
_____
Notifications in Mattermost alert you to unread messages and mentions.

## Email Notifications
Emails are sent for any mentions you receive if you have mattermost closed or have not had any browser activity for a short time.

- Enable or disable email notifications in **Account Settings** > **Notifications** > **Email Notifications**.
- Configure the email address where notifications are sent in **Account Settings** > **General** > **Email** 

## Desktop Notifications
These are browser notifications that appear from the bottom corner of your main monitor. By default these notifications are sent for all activity while Mattermost is open. Desktop notifications are available on Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.

- Configure when desktop notifications are sent from **Account Settings** > **Notifications** > **Send Desktop Notifications**.
- Configure channel specific desktop notifications from **Channel Menu** > **Notification Preferences** > **Send Desktop Notifications**. By default, all channels use the global setting configured in *Account Settings*.


## Notification Sounds
A notification sound plays for all activity that would fire a desktop notification. Notification sounds are available on Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer and Edge.

- Enable or Disable notification sounds in **Account Settings** > **Notifications** > **Desktop Notification Sounds**. 

## Browser Tab Notifications
The browser tab favicon updates to inform you of unread messages and mentions if Mattermost is open in an inactive browser tab. Browser tab notifications are available on Firefox and Chrome.

- Unread messages are denoted by an asterisk (*) next to a black Mattermost icon.
- Mentions are denoted by a red Mattermost icon with the number of unread mentions shown in brackets.
