# Messaging Basics
_____

Write messages using the text input box at the bottom of Mattermost. Press **ENTER** to send a message. Use **Shift+ENTER** to create a new line without sending a message.

Reply to a message by clicking the comment bubble next to the message text.

Notify teammates when they are needed by typing `@username`.

Format your messages using Markdown that supports text styling, headings, links, emoticons, code blocks, block quotes, tables, lists and in-line images.

Attach files by dragging and dropping into Mattermost or clicking the attachment icon in the text input box.
