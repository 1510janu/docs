**Teams**
---------------------
A team is a digital workspace where you and your teammates can collborate on Mattermost. Depending on how Mattermost is set up in your organization, you can belong to 1 team or multiple teams.



**Channels**
---------------------
Channels are used to organize conversations across different topics, they are located on the left-hand panel of your Mattermost application. There are three types of channels: Public Channels, Private Channels, and Direct Messages.


**Public Channels:**

Public Channels are open to everyone on a team. New team members are automatically added to two Public Channels when they sign up: Town Square and Off-Topic.

Public Channels are identified with a **circle icon**

**Private Channels:**

Private Channels are for sensitive topics and are only visible to select team members. Any member of a Private Channel can add additional members. Channel members can choose to leave at any time, but only the channel owner or Team Admin can remove other members.

Private Channels have a **lock icon**

**Direct Messages (DM)**

Direct Messages are for conversations between two people. Group Messages are Direct Messages that have conversations among three or more people. Both are visible only to the people involved.

Use a Direct Message when you want a private conversation with one other person. 

Use a Group Message when you want to quickly set up a conversation with up to seven other participants. If you want more than that, you must create a Private Channel.
