# Signing in
_____

You can sign-in to your team from the web address of `https://domain.com/teamname`. 

## Sign-in Methods
There are several options for signing in to your team depending on how your System Admin has configured your server. 

#### Email Address and Password Sign-in

When enabled by your System Admin, you can sign in using the combination of email address and password used to create your account. 

If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it by clicking **I forgot my password** on the sign-in screen, or contact your System Admin for help resetting your password. 

#### GitLab Single-Sign-On (SSO)

When enabled by your System Admin, you can sign-in using your GitLab account using a one-click sign-in option. GitLab SSO lets you create teams, create accounts on teams, and sign-in to teams using one username, email address, and password that works across everything on the server. 

## Switching Teams

When you've used the same email address to sign-up and sign-in to multiple teams, you can switch among those teams using the **Main Menu**, accessed by clicking the three dots in the top header of any team site on the server. By default, devices remember which teams you have signed into for 30 days.

## Logging Out

You can log out from the **Main Menu**, which is accessed by clicking the three dots in the top header on the left side of the screen. Clicking "Logout" logs you out of all teams that are signed-in and open in your browser.
