## Unread Notifications
Channel name bolding and mention jewels notify you if there’s been activity in channels that you’re a member of since you were last online. When a channel with unreads is opened, there is an unread messages indicator placed at the location of the last read message.

#### Channel Bolding
Unread messages in a channel are indicated by a bold channel name in the left-hand-side (LHS).  Change what activity triggers the channel bolding by clicking the channel dropdown menu, then **Notification Preferences** > **Mark Channel Unread**. Clicking the channel name removes the bolding.

#### Mention Jewels
Unread mentions in a channel are indicated by bold text and a mention jewel next to the channel name in the LHS. Clicking the channel name removes the bolding and mention jewel. You can always review your recent mentions by clicking **@** next to the search box at the top of the screen. Learn more about [mentioning teammates](XXXXXX).

## Linking to a message
The **Permalink** feature creates a link to any message. Sharing this link with other users in the channel lets them view the linked message in the Message Archives. Users who are not a member of the channel where the message was posted cannot view the permalink.
