Messages
================

Messages and replies to messages can be composed in two places:
 
-  the center pane
-  the right-hand sidebar 
 
Sending Messages
-----------------

Press **Enter** to send a message. To use paragraphs, press **Shift + Enter** to create a new line. If you want to, you can change the settings to send messages with **Ctrl + Enter** instead:

-  **Main Menu > Account Settings > Send messages on Ctrl + Enter**

Replying to Messages
---------------------

Click the reply icon next to any message to open the right-hand sidebar where you can compose and send your reply. Replies are indented slightly in the center pane to indicate that they are child messages of a parent message.

When composing a reply in the right-hand sidebar, you can click the expand/shrink icon with two arrows at the top of the sidebar to make things easier to read.

Editing Messages
-----------------

-  Click the **[...]** icon next to a message that you have sent > click **Edit**.

Your System Administrator may disable the **Edit** feature or set a time limit before messages become uneditable.

.. note::
  Message edits do not trigger new @mention notifications, desktop notifications, or notification sounds.

Deleting Messages
------------------

-  Click the **[...]** icon next to a message that you have sent > click **Delete**.

Your System Administrator may disable the **Delete** feature.

Linking to Messages
--------------------

-  Click the **[...]** icon next to a message > click **Permalink > Copy Link**.

Sharing this link lets other users view the linked message in the Message Archives. If the link is to a message in a Public Channel, any user of the team can see the message. If the link is to a message in a Private Group, only users in that group can see the message.

.. tip::
  The timestamp that appears beside the username of any message is also a permalink.
