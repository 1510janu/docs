Messages
================
 
Sending messages and replying to messages are important ways to keep conversation active with your team. You can edit and delete messages after you have sent them. You can also generate and share links to any message in Mattermost.

Sending Messages
-----------------

Press **Enter** to send a message. To use paragraphs, press **Shift + Enter** to create a new line. If you want to, you can change the settings to send messages with **Ctrl + Enter** instead:

-  **Main Menu > Account Settings > Send messages on Ctrl + Enter**

Replying to Messages
---------------------

-  Click the **[...]** icon next to a message > click **Edit**. This keeps conversations organized in threads.

To adjust the width of the right-hand sidebar, click the expand/shrink icon with two arrows at the top of the sidebar.
Replies are indented slightly in the center pane to indicate that they are child messages of a parent message.

Editing Messages
-----------------

-  Click the **[...]** icon next to a message that you have sent > click **Edit**.

Your System Administrator may disable the **Edit** feature or set a time limit before messages become uneditable.

.. note::
  Message edits do not trigger new @mention notifications, desktop notifications, or notification sounds.

Deleting Messages
------------------

-  Click the **[...]** icon next to a message that you have sent > click **Delete**.

Your System Administrator may disable the **Delete** feature.

Linking to Messages
--------------------

-  Click the **[...]** icon next to a message > click **Permalink > Copy Link**.

If the link is to a message in a Public Channel, any user of the team can see the message. If the link is to a message in a Private Group, only users in that group can see the message.

.. tip::
  The timestamp that appears beside the username of any message is also a permalink.
