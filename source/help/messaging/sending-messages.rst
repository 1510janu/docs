Sending messages is an effective way to keep conversation active with your team. [Add more benefits]

Messages
================

Messages and replies to messages can be composed in two places:
 
-  the center pane
-  the right-hand sidebar 
 
Depending on your system configuration, you can edit and delete messages after you have sent them. You can also generate and share links to any message in Mattermost.

Sending Messages
-----------------

Type into the text input box to write a message, then press Enter to send it. If you want to use paragraphs, press **Shift + Enter** to create a new line. 

[A Tip:] If you are accustomed to create a new line when pressing **Enter**, you might sometimes accidentally send a message too early since the settings are configured to send a message with the Enter button. If you want to, you can change the settings to send messages with **Ctrl + Enter**:

-  **Main Menu > Account Settings > Send messages on Ctrl + Enter**

Replying to a Message
---------------------

Reply to messages to keep conversations organized in threads. Click the reply icon next to any message text to open the right-hand sidebar where you can compose and send your reply. Replies are indented slightly in the center pane to indicate that they are child messages of a parent message.

When composing a reply in the right-hand sidebar, click the expand/collapse icon with two arrows at the top of the sidebar to make things easier to read.

Editing a Message
-----------------

Edit a message by clicking the **[...]** icon next to a message that you have sent, then click **Edit**. Your System Administrator may disable the **Edit** feature or set a time limit before messages become uneditable.

.. note::
  Message edits do not trigger new @mention notifications, desktop notifications, or notification sounds.

Deleting a Message
------------------

Delete a message by clicking the **[...]** icon next to a message that you have sent, then click **Delete**. Your System Administrator may disable the **Delete** feature.

Linking to a Message
--------------------

The permalink feature creates a link to any message. Get the permalink to any message by clicking the **[...]** icon next to a message, then click **Permalink > Copy Link**. Sharing this link lets other users view the linked message in the Message Archives. If the link is to a message in a Public Channel, any user of the team can see the message. If the link is to a message in a Private Group, only other users in the group can see the message.

.. tip::
  The timestamp that appears beside the username of any message is also a permalink.
