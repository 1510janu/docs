Attaching Files
===============

--------------

With attachments, you can share additional information that will help your 
team to visually understand your ideas. Sharing videos, voice recordings,
screenshots, and images can make your messages more effective and clear.

How to Attach Files
------------------
You can attach a file in three simple ways:

-  Click the attachment icon
-  Drag and Drop
-  Paste from the clipboard

Attachment Icon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can upload files by clicking the paperclip icon inside the message
input box. This opens up your system file viewer where you can navigate
to the desired files. Double-click the file or click Open to upload the
chosen files to the message input box. Then, press ENTER to post.

Drag and Drop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can attach files by dragging them from your computer into the 
message input box either on the right-hand sidebar or the center pane.
After dropping the files, press ENTER to post.

Paste from the Clipboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you use Chrome or Edge browsers, you can also upload files by 
pasting them from the clipboard. This feature is not yet supported on 
other browsers.

File Previewer
--------------
Mattermost has a built in file previewer that you can use to:

-  Download files
-  Share public links
-  View media

Click the thumbnail of an attached file to open it in the file previewer.

Downloading Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can download an attached file in two ways:

-  click the download icon next to the file thumbnail
-  open the file previewer and click Download

Sharing Public Links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Public links allow you to share attachments with people outside your 
Mattermost team. Open the file previewer by clicking on the thumbnail of
an attachment, then click Get Public Link. This opens a dialog box with 
a link to copy. When the link is shared and opened by another user, the 
file will automatically download.

Change to a Tip: If Get Public Link is not visible in the file previewer
and you prefer that the feature is enabled, you can request your System 
Administrator to enable the feature from the System Console under 
Security > Public Links.

Viewing Media:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you are trying to preview a media type that is not supported, the 
file previewer will open a standard media attachment icon. Supported 
media formats depend on your browser and operating system, but the 
following formats are supported on most browsers:

-  Images: BMP, GIF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, SVG
-  Video: MP4
-  Audio: MP3, M4A
-  Files: PDF, TXT

Other document previews (Word, Excel, PPT) are not yet supported.

Attachment Limits and Sizes
---------------------
Please note that Mattermost supports a maximum of five (5) attached 
files per post.

The default maximum file size is 50MB, but this can be changed by the 
System Administrator.
