Language and spelling
=====================

Write documents in English, and use American spelling conventions.

Commas
======

As a general rule, the serial comma results in greater clarity. However, there are always edge cases where a serial comma adds confusion to a sentence. Therefore, the Mattermost documentation will use the following rule for commas:

Use the serial comma unless doing so decreases clarity and understanding of the sentence.

Good
  The cows ran from wolves, coyotes, and mosquitoes.

Not Good
  The cows ran from wolves, coyotes and mosquitoes.

Tone
====

Use a direct, impartial tone. Most readers of the documentation are looking for answers and solutions to their problems; they are not looking for entertainment.

Good
  Magna Lorem duis mollit mollit minim amet proident incididunt ut consectetur.

Not good
  Sint nostrud veniam esse pariatur laboris in esse commodo aute duis deserunt amet dolore eu.

Capitalization
==============

Voice
=====

Use active voice in preference to passive voice. Active voice has the subject of a sentence doing the action, and in passive voice, the subject has an action done to it. Use passive voice when you want to emphasize the action more than the subject.

Active voice
  Veniam mollit ipsum excepteur dolore deserunt do aute incididunt nostrud enim adipisicing.

Passive voice
  Nulla est adipisicing aliquip eu dolor deserunt magna culpa consectetur.

Numbers
=======

Use decimal numbers except when the number is the first word of a sentence. Use commas to make long numbers easier to read.

Good
  Three cows ran for 6 kilometers when they saw 2,300,097 mosquitoes chasing them.

inline code - monospace
code block - monospace
