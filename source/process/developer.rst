====================================
Developers
====================================

At Mattermost, staff developers are thoughtful, highly independent engineers who work with both our open source contributor community and other Mattermost staff to improve our software on a regular basis.

All Mattermost staff developers are also `core committers <https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/contribution-guide.html#core-committers>`_ on one or more official Mattermost repositories. They work closely with product management to envision, design, plan, develop, coordinate, review and merge improvements per our `contribution guidelines <https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/contribution-guide.html>`_ on a regular basis. 

Ideally, developers are "full stack", and comfortable moving across backend and frontend projects. As part of our `learn, master, teach <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#learn-master-teach>`_ mindset, our environment has people consistently cross-training, becoming experts and passing on knowledge to new team members rotating into new areas of responsibility. That said, we also welcome engineers who prefer to specialize in backend and frontend, since there's ample projects to find in both areas.  

Responsibilities
-------------------------

- Develop features from proposal to polished end result.
- Support and collaborate with our community service engineers to find the root cause of issues, find, deliver and document effective solutions.

- Take initiative in improving the software in small or large ways to address pain points in your own experience as a developer.
- Keep code easy to maintain. Keep it easy for others to contribute code.
- Help identify, vet and recruit other developers to join our community and, when appropriate, as staff developers.

Frequently Asked Questions

Do you have internships? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While we no longer offer internships for developers, if you get a couple of `Help Wanted <https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=org%3Amattermost+state%3Aopen+Help+Wanted&type=Issues&ref=searchresults?>`_ pull requests accepted, we'll interview you for one. This will be a remote internship without supervision; you'll only get feedback on your merge requests. If you want to work on open source and qualify `please submit an application <https://jobs.lever.co/mattermost/>`_. In the cover letter field, please note that you want an internship and link to the accepted pull requests. The pull requests should be of significant value and difficulty, which is at the discretion of the hiring manager. For example, fixing 10 typos isn't as valuable as shipping 2 new features.
