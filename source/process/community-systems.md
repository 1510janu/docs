#### Duplicate of issue Accepting Pull Request

```
Hi @[GITHUB_USERNAME], thanks for the report!

There's a [known issue accepting pull requests](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/PLT-835) and we're hoping to have it resolved before the next release. 

Our hope is to find a community member who'd like to knock this out as a [good first contribution project](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=10206), and if not, then it'll fall into the core team's priority queue, 

We try to balance providing opportunities for the community to participate with product quality, 
```
