Mattermost Documentation Style Guide
====================================

This is the Mattermost style guide for documentation. It acts as a reference for writers and editors to ensure that the Mattermost documentation is consistent and clear.

.. Note::
  The style guide is not intended to slow down or otherwise impede contributions, which are always welcome. No contribution will be rejected due to non-conforming style, although it might be edited.

The Mattermost documentation must be of high quality. It must be accurate and clear, and be presented with a style and tone that is appropriate for technical content. People who use Mattermost rely on the documentation to get their jobs done. We don't want to see an installation of Mattermost delayed because the documentation has an error or is difficult to understand.

  how to link to other documents. ie, not click here

  should be no need for section breaks, ie ---------- that gets output as <br>

  avoid documenting features; instead, document tasks. describe things that people want to do

  Steps: Each step should describe one action. Each step should be a complete sentence.

  avoid noun clusters. that is, three or more nouns in a row

  Use might or can instead of may. use 'may' only when giving permission.
