Spec Review Process
===================

This is a rough guideline for the process for drafting and reviewing specs. It’s meant to be used as a starting point, but not all specs will follow this exact process - please use your judgment, as it’s something that will vary depending on the situation.

1. Brainstorm / research.
    - Research topic
    - Research customer requirements
    - Pair design brainstorm
    - User workflows
    - Consider options / vision for UI
2. Initial draft.
    - Goal / “Why"

      - Link to customer data / feedback
      - Link back to company objectives
    - User Stories
    - Rough and Quick Wireframes / Mock ups

      - Flows of screens
      - Focus should be on the mock ups, with text that supports design

    - Questions
    - “Not in scope”
    - Success Metrics
    - Pair reviews

      - Iterate on designs as needed
      - Early check in with developers to identify any potential issues
3. Share with team.
    - Post draft with @channel in Spec Review channel, asking to review and add comments.
4. Spec review.
    - Schedule a meeting with interested people to discuss comments and any other questions about the spec:

      - UX Design
      - Product Manager
      - Developer
      - Test
5. Update draft.
    - Update based on feedback. Update wireframes / mock ups.
6. Review again.
    - Post updated draft in Spec Review channel, asking the people who previously commented for another review.
    - Share with interested customers for feedback
7. Repeat reviews/updates.
    - Repeat as needed until final draft is signed off on.**
8. **Break into tickets with dev.**
