Vision
---------------------------------------------------------

Increase popularity of Mattermost by empowering the community to have an impact by contributing features and extensions that would not otherwise be offered

Principles
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Focus on areas with high impact-to-mana ratio.
2. It should be easy and straightforward to start contributing.
3. Community building should be directed towards 3R’s: Recognition, Retention and Recruitment

Reality Check
---------------------------------------------------------

1. You cannot attract contributors without attracting users.
  
  - For every 1000 users, 100 file bugs, 10 submit a patch, 1 reads the contribution guidelines

2. Set realistic expectations to contributors.

  - Majority of contributors will not be experts. Also, contributing to open source is typically a hobby / side job.

3. There's thousands of other open source projects so it's very easy to leave to another project.

4. Community building is mana intensive.

  - You need to train contributors, dev and PM review PRs, and create recognition programs with specific roles to people.

Audiences
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Integration builders (Owner: Jason)

  - They create extensions to Mattermost to third-party integrations and plug-ins.
  - Some might build drivers to more easily integrate Mattermost into different programming languages
  - Examples: Popular third-party software (e.g. Jira, Jenkins), Slack-compatible integrations (e.g. Slackbot), Custom Mattermost integrations (e.g. Matterbridge, Mattermail), Plug-ins (to come)

2. Orchestration solution maintainers (Owner: Lindsay)

  - They create deployment solution programs to more easily install and deploy Mattermost
  - Examples: Modules (e.g. Puppet, Heroku), Installers (e.g. Yunohost, Chef Cookbook) and Package managers (Bitnami, HPE Gold)

3. Code contributors (Owner: Eric)

  - They contribute features, small improvements and bug fixes to platform, mobile and desktop app repos

4. End users (Owner: Lindy)

  - They ask for help troubleshooting issues, report bugs, share UX feedback and propose new features
  - Examples: forum.mattermost.org, GitHub repos, uservoice

5. Localization (Owner: Jason)

  - They help translate and maintain languages in Pootle translation server

6. Writers (Owner: TBD)

  - They help write documentation, write tutorials and “how-to” articles, and blog posts

7. Designers (Owner: TBD)

  - They help with feature design and review processes
