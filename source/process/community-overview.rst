Community 
---------------------------------------------------------

At Mattermost, we be believe workplace messaging will become a leading platform for workflow and business process. We believe building such a platform on open source infrastructure has powerful benefits.  

We consider people who share these beliefs, and who seek to benefit from or influence the Mattermost open source project in pursuit of this vision, to be part of the "Mattermost Community". 

The success of Mattermost as an open source platform for messaging-based workflow and business process depends on empowering our community to build with us towards a shared vision. 

Users   
---------------------------------------------------------

In general, all members of the Mattermost community are users of the open source project. They may be end users on a system, administrators, or developers on the Mattermost platform in some way, and the common bond we all share is we benefit from the project's continued and growing success. 

Contributors  
---------------------------------------------------------

A subset of the Mattermost community as "contributors" who help increase the overall benefits of Mattermost for others. This may be as simple as offering feature ideas or reporting bugs, offering professional services to install or deploy the system, or it can be as involved as building whole new products based on Mattermost, or contributing code to the underlying software. 

The work of all contributors is valued, appreciated and recognized as a driving force behind the project's growth.  

There are many ways to contribute: 

Solution Contributors   
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of July 2018, `over 1000 open source projects on GitHub reference Mattermost <https://github.com/search?q=mattermost>`_. Solution Builders create a host of technologies to empower Mattermost software to solve real world problems. Technologies include: 

- **Self-hosted Integration Solutions** - Includes connectivity and integration with 3rd party applications such as Jira, Confluence, GitLab, Jenkins and other tools 
- **SaaS-based Integration Solutions** - Includes connectivity and integration with services like Twitter, Zendesk, Salesforce and hundreds of other extensions with services like Zapier.
- **Programming Solutions** - Includes language-specific drivers and connectors to simplify the work of other developers 
- **Mattermost User Experience Plug-Ins** - Includes server and client-side plug-ins that enhance the native capabilities of a Mattermost server, such as voice, video and screensharing with Zoom's self-hosted or vendor-hosted solutions.  
- **Federated Experiences** - Includes bridges with IRC, Slack and other messaging applications through solutions like Matterbridge
- **Custom User Experiences** - Includes integrations into Terminal and Pidgin built off the same core APIs as Mattermost's Web, Desktop, iOS and Android experiences

Principles
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Focus on areas with high impact-to-`mana <https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#mana>`_ ratio.
2. It should be easy and straightforward to start contributing.
3. Community building should be directed towards 3Râ€™s: Recognition, Retention and Recruitment.

Context 
---------------------------------------------------------

1. You need a community of users to attract a community of contributors. 
 
  - For every 10,000 users, 100 might file bugs or request features, 10 might read the contribution guidelines, 1 might submit a patch.

2. Expectations for contributors need to be realistic.

  - Contributing to open source is often a hobby or a side job. Expect the majority of contributors not to be experts. 

3. There are thousands of other open source projects.

  - It is very easy to leave to another project since there are many open source projects to choose from.

4. Community building is mana intensive.

  - You need to train contributors, developers and PMs to review PRs and create recognition programs that give specific roles to people.
