# Accepting Pull Requests

Per the [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/mattermost/platform/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), only PRs that reference Jira tickets with the "accepting pull requests" (APR) label should be submitted to the [Mattermost/Platform](https://github.com/mattermost/platform) repo. This system ensures:

1. Proposed changes have been thoughtfully reviewed 
2. Volunteers are willing to test, document, and support the changes
3. The change meets the [fast, obvious, forgiving](http://www.mattermost.org/design-principles/) design principle for the project.
4. The change [aligns to the stated purpose of the project](http://www.mattermost.org/vision/#mattermost-teams-v1)

Key contributors and core team members are responsible opening Jira tickets that meet the above requirements, which are then reviewed in triage meetings. 

#### Checklist for Accepting Pull Request Ticket 

When opening Jira tickets for accepting-pull-requests core team members should:

1. Use titles that clearly describe the needed change and its value 
2. Include (Proposed APR) in title, so triage team knows to add the APR tag if appropriate
3. Provide unambiguous description so that feature can be implemented and tested by any volunteer
4. Link back to community discussions related to this change
5. Post link back to community channels

The triage team will add `accepting-pull-requests` label to have the ticket appear in the [issues Accepting Pull Requests](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=10101) list.
