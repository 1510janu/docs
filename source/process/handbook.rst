About Mattermost
##################################################

Mattermost, Inc. is a company based on the Mattermost open source project. Mattermost software is used by thousands of organizations around the world in 16 languages.

Mission
------------------------------------------

Our mission is to empower every organization to achieve their highest priorities through modern communication.

Our vision is a world more connected to what matters most.

Values
------------------------------------------

Values are deliberate choices defining our behavior. When facing complexity, uncertainty, or ambiguity (CUA) we determine our point of view and our actions through the lens of our values:

- **Customer Obsession** - We exist to make customers successful. In everything we do, start with customer perspective and work backwards. Earn and keep their trust.

- **Ownership** - Own the outcomes of your activity. Don't drop the ball. When we see a vacuum on something important, we jump in--we never say "it's not my job."

- **High Impact** - Figure out what matters most, and focus on those priorities. When deciding to work on low impact or high impact projects, choose high impact.

- **Self-Awareness** - We understand and seek to understand our strengths and growth opportunities, as individuals and organizations. We are open to critique and share critique constructively and respectfully. 

- **Be proud of what you build** - Insist on high standards. Ensure that you're building the highest quality products, services, and processes possible, and constantly raising the bar.

Company 
-------------- 

Mattermost is an open source, remote-first, communities-centered company based in Palo Alto, California and headquartered on the internet. 

**Open source** means by default we make our technology, business process and source code available to the public. We develop a small portion as propreitary technology, built upon our open source work, to license for subscription fees that enable more high quality open source work to be produced. Since the start of the Mattermost open source project in 2015 we have used this model to develop effective open source solutions for the world to use. This model is sometimes called [Thin Open Core](https://medium.com/open-consensus/2-open-core-definition-examples-tradeoffs-e4d0c044da7c).

**Remote-first** means by default our staff works anywhere in the world where a) we have support for quality video calling and b) where we can work in a legally appropriate environment. Mattermost was born in an extraordinary age where organizations can attract, hire and enable remote teams--working out of homes coffee shops and co-working spaces across timezones--to produce better technology and business results in less time than purely office-based teams, while maintaining security and compliance standards. 

Remote-first culture flourishes when we share one simple principle: **Courtesy**. Courtesy means Mattermosters are thoughtful about keeping our communities appropriately informed, following etiquette for discussions, calls and video meetings, and giving and receiving feedback on how to work better together. Courtesy also means we gladly accomodate those who prefer to work out of a dedicated office. We are remote-first, not remote-only. 

**Communities-centered** means we define our success in the context of the success of our [communities](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/community-overview.html): users, customers, implementers, resellers, technology partners, contributors, and colleagues. The success of each community is owned by a member of the Mattermost leadership team. The plural definition of "communities" is intended to avoid unconsciously marginalizing downstream stakeholders. Referring to open source contributers as "the community", as if no other communities should be recognized, is like saying "a developer should format his code according to the style guide of the project". These statements may sound normal to the speaker, but they can unintentionally marginalize others.  

**Based in Palo Alto, California and headquartered on the internet** means the mailing address for Mattermost, Inc. is in Palo Alto, California, and our headquarters is on the internet, specifically the Mattermost instance at https://community.mattermost.com. Our online headquarters is where Mattermost staff work with our communities of colleagues, users, partners, customers and contributors, to envision, develop and refine new open source technologies to make the world safer and more productive. Staff at headquarters, working in an open source, remote-first, communities-centered company are "Mattermosters". Staff who choose to work from an office are called "Commuters".
