Guest Articles for Mattermost Apps and Services
===============================================================

This document outlines some of the procedures in developing guest articles. Mattermost, Inc. is excited to bring attention to guest company creators and their experiences with using Mattermost.

**Article Writer:**

Follow these guidelines to develop a clear and concise guest article:

-	Commission a banner which includes the guest company creator's photo (using a grayscale effect), the guest company's logo, and a heading. Use this example as a template: https://about.mattermost.com/sourced-group-offers-mattermost-as-a-service-for-enterprises/. Visit "Marketing: Graphics" channel for examples on how to commission a banner.
-	Begin the article with a short bio and introduction of the company creator(s). Include a link to the guest company's website the first time the company name is mentioned in the text.
-	Include a screenshot of the guest company's logo in the post.
-	At the end of the post, include a short summary of the guest company as well as a call for readers to share feedback on the company.

**Guest Company Creators:**

You will be asked to provide the following for Mattermost by email:

-	Please provide a photo and a short bio of yourself. Photos and bios of each of the guest company creators are more than welcome. The size of the photo should be large enough so that it can be easily included in a banner or as a screenshot in an article. The bio should be as short as one to two sentences.
-	When we have prepared a draft of the article, we will send it to you by email and will ask you to review it and provide any feedback and recommendations on it.
