# Terminology 

Mattermost terminology used across the project. 

#### Bug

A defect in the code that varies from specification. Changes required to accomodate unsupported 3rd party software (such as browsers or operating systems) are not considered bugs, they care considered improvements. 

#### FX Guidelines

Short for "Fan eXperience Guidelines" defining usability requirements to turn users into fans.

#### Improvement 

A beneficial change to code that is not fixing a bug. 

#### LHS

The "Left-Hand Sidebar" in the Mattermost team site, used for navigation.

#### Mana

An estimate of energy, attention and effort required to complete a project, similar to "points" or "jelly beans" in an Agile/Scrum methodology. On average, full time Mattermost developers each complete tickets adding up to approximately 28 mana per week. A "small" item is 2 mana, a "medium" is 4, a "large" is 8 and any project bigger needs to be broken down into smaller tickets. 

#### RHS

The "Right-Hand Sidebar" in the Mattermost team site, used for navigation.
