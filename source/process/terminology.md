# Terminology 

Mattermost terminology used across the project. 

#### 0/5, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 5/5 

We use "x/5" to concisely communicate conviction. 0/5 means you don't have a strong opinion, you are just sharing an idea or asking a question. 5/5 means you are highly confident and would stake your reputation on the opinion you're expressing. 

#### APR

Acronym for [Accepting Pull Request](http://docs.mattermost.com/process/accepting-pull-request.html) tickets, which are vetted changes to the source code open for community contributions.  

#### Bug

An obvious error in Mattermost software. Changes required to accomodate unsupported 3rd party software (such as browsers or operating systems) are not considered bugs, they are considered improvements. 

#### Crimson Force Field

When on screen text, particularly error messages, isn't helpful to its intended audience we call it a "Crimson Force Field" situation. This implies the text presented is not substantially better than using random words like "Crimson Force Field" to explain things, and may even be worse, if the text ends up misleading its audience. 

#### Dead Tarzan 

The idea of letting go of an imperfect solution without a clearly thought out alternative. Based on idea of [Tarzan of the Jungle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarzan) letting go of a vine without having a new vine to swing to. 

#### Dev Mana

A specific type of mana for developers similar to "points" or "jelly beans" in an Agile/Scrum methodology. On average, full time Mattermost developers each complete tickets adding up to approximately 28 mana per week. A "small" item is 2 mana, a "medium" is 4, a "large" is 8 and any project bigger needs to be broken down into smaller tickets. 

#### FX Guidelines

Short for "Fan eXperience Guidelines" defining usability requirements to turn users into fans.

#### Improvement 

A beneficial change to code that is not fixing a bug. 

#### LHS

The "Left-Hand Sidebar" in the Mattermost team site, used for navigation.

#### Mana

An estimate of total energy, attention and effort required for a task. 

A one-line change to code can cost more mana than a 100-line change due to risk and the need for documentation, testing, support and all the other activities needed. 

Every feature added has an initial and on-going mana cost, which is taken into account in feature decsions. 

#### RHS

The "Right-Hand Sidebar" in the Mattermost team site, used for navigation.

#### Windows Vista approach

An attempt to add functionality through a massive, complex one-time re-write hoping to improve the architecture, but which likely ends in repeated delays, wasted effort, buggy code and limited architectural improvement (compared to re-writing the architecture in phases). This tempting, high risk approach is named after Microsoft's "Windows Vista" operating system, one of its most famous examples.
