Instructions on how to create and edit “Mattermost User’s Guide” documents:

1. First, describe the benefits of the future for end users.
2. Proceed to explain how to carry out the future (such as attaching files) by using short bullet points as well as screenshots as
applicable.
3. Include useful tips as applicable.

If a document includes multiple features that are related to each other, order them based on what functionality is used 
the most (e.g. How to attach files > File previewer > Sharing public links).

**Additional instructions if editing an existing document:**
1.	Write a draft first - start fresh
2.	Compare to the original document to add any important missing information
