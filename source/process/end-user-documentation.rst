Creating and editing Mattermost Userâ€™s Guide documents:
====================================================================================

This document describes the best practices for creating documentation for `end users <https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/user.html>`.

1. Start the document by describing the benefits of the feature (such as attaching files) for end users.
2. Proceed to explain how to use the feature by using short bullet points as well as screenshots as
applicable.
3. Include useful tips as applicable.

If a document includes multiple features that are related to each other, order them based on what functionality is used 
the most, e.g.: How to attach files > File previewer > Sharing public links.

**Additional instructions if editing an existing document:**
1.	Start fresh and begin by writing a draft in a Google document.
2.	Compare to the original document to add any important missing information or tips.
