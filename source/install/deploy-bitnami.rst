Deploy Mattermost on Bitnami
=============================

Through our partnership with Bitnami you can automatically deploy Mattermost Team Edition to a demonstration server for up to 1 hour, up to 10 times per platform, including: 

- `Amazon Web Services <https://about.mattermost.com/deploy-aws>`_
- `Oracle Cloud Platform <https://about.mattermost.com/deploy-oracle>`_ 
- `Microsoft Azure <https://about.mattermost.com/deploy-azure>`_
- `Google Cloud Platform <https://about.mattermost.com/deploy-googlecloud>`_

Alternatively, you may also deploy to `Debian 8 VMware or Oracle VirtualBox virtual machines <https://about.mattermost.com/deploy-debianvirtualmachine>`_.

If you have an existing account, or choose to create a new account, you can run your auto-deployed Mattermost instance as long as you would like.
