1. Don't offer advice on database modification without a clear warning
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Never give DB advice without a warning similar to: `Manual database modification bypass checks in the code and could make a system unrecoverable. It's not recommended and if you do make a change, make sure to back up your DB, and verify changes carefully.`
