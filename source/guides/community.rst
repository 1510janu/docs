1. Don't offer advice on database modification without a clear warning
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manual modifications to a database can put it into an unrecoverable state. Never give such advice without a warning similar to: `Manual modification to the database can put it into an unrecoverable state that cannot be supported. If you're going to change anything, make sure to back up your DB, and test the change carefully, and realize there can be unforeseen effects.`
