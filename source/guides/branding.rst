Naming Usage Guidelines
-------------------------------

Using the Mattermost name is generally fine so long as it’s used in a non-commercial way and does not imply endorsement by Mattermost, Inc.

- Please do not name your integrations or apps starting with, or only using, the name “Mattermost”, as this may confuse end users as to where to find support

We ask community projects might be named using “for Mattermost”, examples:

- GitLab Integration Service for Mattermost
- Giphy Integration Service for Mattermost 

Alternatively, community projects may concatenate names containing Mattermost, for example:

- Matterbridge – is a Mattermost bridge connecting with IRC
- Mattersend – is a Mattermost integration for sending webhook events

Exception: Please don’t use the name “matterbot”, as that is an internal service under development.

As the Mattermost project grows, when there are multiple open source projects for similar Mattermost integrations we ask our community to include the owner of the repro, for example: 

- `Hubot Adapter for Mattermost by Heitor Lessa <https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-mattermost>`_
- `Hubot Adapter for Mattermost by Andy Lo-A-Foe <https://github.com/loafoe/hubot-matteruser>`_
