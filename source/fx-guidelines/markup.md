## Bootstrap Classes

Since we’re using bootstrap, try to utilize bootstrap classes as much as possible rather than creating new styles or using inline styles.

## Custom Styles

We’re using BEM methodology and would advise everyone to do so when creating new classes or ids. There’s a lot of places in our app that currently don’t follow BEM but we’re trying to improve the codebase.
