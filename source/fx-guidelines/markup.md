## Bootstrap Classes

Since we’re using [bootstrap](<http://getbootstrap.com/), try to utilize [bootstrap classes](<http://getbootstrap.com/css/>) as much as possible rather than creating new styles or using inline styles.

## Custom Styles

We’re using [BEM methodology](https://en.bem.info/method/) and would advise everyone to do so when creating new classes or ids. There’s a lot of places in our app that currently don’t follow BEM but we’re trying to improve the codebase. [Here](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) is a brief overview of the BEM syntax.
