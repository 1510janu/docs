___

The purpose of the Mattermost FX Guidelines doc is to align our team around a set of standards to reduce ambiguity in building our fan experience and file tickets to course correct when we deviate from the standards we set.

## Principles

As our team and service evolve, the number and precision level of our standards will also increase, which in turn increases product quality.

#### Responsive (Fast)
Any action by a fan always creates a response to let the fan know something is happening. Experience should feel quick and snappy.

#### Consistent (Obvious)
Fans should have a comfortable, familiar experience. Donâ€™t force the fan to re-learn by having two different ways of doing similar actions, or displaying the same information

#### Easy (Forgiving)
Common functions should be obvious and quick to find. Advanced options should be possible to find after some logical searching, and not clutter the core experience.
