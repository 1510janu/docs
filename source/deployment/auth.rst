Multi-Factor Authentication (Enterprise)
======
*Available in May 16, 2016 release* 

For increased security, Mattermost Enterprise Edition offers the option to require a phone-based passcode, in addition to email-password or Active Directory/LDAP authentication, to sign in to the Mattermost server. 

Supported phones include iOS, Android, Blackberry and Windows Phone devices that are able to install `Google Authenticator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator>`_. Other than requiring internet access to download and install Google Authenticator, the phone used for Mattermost MFA does not require internet access. 

This option can be enabled by the System Administrator in the `System Console <http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#service-settings>`_ under **Service Settings** > **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication**

End users can set up this feature under **Account Settings** > **Security** > **Multi-Factor Authentication** from the main menu of the team site.
