  <p>We&#8217;re working on making internal processes in the Mattermost core team more transparent for the community. Below is a working draft of our software development process, which will be updated live as we refine our process.</p>
<p>Questions, feedback, comments always welcome,</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Mattermost core team works on a monthly release process, with a new version shipping on the 16th of each month.</p>
<p>This document outlines the development process for the Mattermost core team, which draws from what we find works best for us from Agile, Scrum and Software Development Lifecycle approaches.</p>
<p>This is a working document that will update as our process evolves.</p>
